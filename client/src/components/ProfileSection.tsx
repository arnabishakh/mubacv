          As a Computer Science graduate specializing in Information Systems with a focus on machine learning, 
          computer vision, and data science, I have built a strong academic foundation complemented by hands-on 
          research experience. My research interests lie in advancing healthcare, cybersecurity, data privacy 
          preservation, and educational applications of AI, and I am eager to further explore these areas at the 
          graduate level. I am seeking research and funding opportunities to collaborate with a supervisor whose 
          interests align with mine, utilizing state-of-the-art labs and research methodologies to contribute 
          meaningfully to the field.
